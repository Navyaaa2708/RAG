Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning techniques can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. It is widely used in various applications, including image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and natural language processing.
